title: Scale to Zero
---

For free Starter Plan users, Turso dynamically scales databases down to zero after an hour of no activity. This behaviour is how we can continue to provide hundreds of databases on the free plan.

When a request is made, the databases automatically scale back up to one. There may be a delay of up to `500ms` for databases that have been inactive.

<Info>

[Database groups](/concepts#groups) with extended inactivity (**10 days**) will require a manual "unarchive" operation using the [CLI](/cli/group/unarchive) or API.
